      My Dear George
I really have not time to write you in answer to your letter of Oct. last but I must send a line, if but a line. Promptness and punctuality are necessary to correspondence. I am always grieved and disappointed when my friends do not respond heartily, promptly.
I know you will rejoice at the success which has attended the opening of my new church. I have been having an old revival time. Sinners slain, and the work of the Lord made manifest in healings power. It does seem strange to see these heathens tremble & work. But I must refer you to the Wesleyan for particulars. What a work the dear "Georgia Brother" has done for our China Mission in giving us this magnificent little church. You know him full well and I wish I dare tell you his name that you might commune with him. He is a man whose soul is in sympathy with the Cross of Christ.
What a grand time you had in the mountains. Perhaps you will be there when this reaches you as I see that more than one has suggested that you would be the right man in the right place if sent there to put some things right, etc. I was so sad to hear that the great, & proud old patriarch had gone at last, and how sad to think that the Bishop was absent. I could almost work in sympathy for the blind man, for I dearly love Bishop Pierce. Pardon this haste there is absolutely no alternative. God bless you my dear George & all your family.
Ever Yours,Young J. Allen
