    Suchow
   Dear Dr Allen,          
 Nov17.1.68.

    I announce you the sad tiding our TheonSung Song who has lately moved up to Suchow, died to day about half past 10 Oclock. he had Typhoid fever for only 10 days. & just as I was getting near his house, he breathed his last. his wife came for me & went with her as quickly as I could & sorry to inform you, his wife & his mother has been to Temple to entreat idols for his behalf, & they were burning inscense incense & candles & I told them it was no use. But they continued to do so. & I think they will bury him accorddingaccording to heathen customs, & I advise them not to do it. & I hope they will act accorddingaccording to my words. Pray for his poor wife and children. 
  I am yours truly
C.K. Marshall.
