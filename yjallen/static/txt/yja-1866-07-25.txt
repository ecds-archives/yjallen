    Letter from Young John Allen to Brother Yates, July 25, 1866
    My dear Bro. Yates,
    Your Proposition at once so simple and comprehensive and (so analogous in) the terms suggested so analogous to those used in our own vernacular, meeting alike the wants of the Press and the Pulpit, and harmonizing, or compromising, without sacrifices the peculiar views of those to whom it is advanced, meet my hearty concurrense-
    
    Yours Truly
    Young J. Allen
    25 July 1866
