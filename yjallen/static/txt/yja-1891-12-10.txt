San Francisco, Cal.
    Dec. 10th, 1891
    Rev. Y. J. Allen DDDear Teacher,

	Since I wrote you the last one in Yokohama, I had a pleasant trip across the Pacific ocean. I arrivearrived here last Sunday morning, but I was kept on board until yesterday. After we arrived in San Francisco, the Custom officer came and took away all our passports. He let all the Japanese wentgo away but keep kept all the Chinese on the steamer. The next day he came again and examined us. He asked me many questions and also took away any introducing letters. He took Mr. Masters and Dr. Hannon's letters for evidences. The next day the examiner came again and wrote down all the statement which I have told him and then I signed my name. On the same day (i.e. Tuesday) I wrote a letter to Mr. Masters and so he came down the steamer to see me. I told him the statement and he went down to the Customs to see the collector. Mr. Masters told me to remove my things to his house after I landed yesterday. I came on shore and remove any things to Mr. Master's house. I am now living in the Y.M.C.A. room. The native christians (Cantonese) are so kind to me especially the native preacher Mr. Cahn and they all treated me by term

	I was told that Dr. Hannon is not in this city. He went to somewhere else on account of his bad health so I will not go & see him. But I will try to go and see Bishop Fitzgerald today. I hope I will stay here two or three daydaysand going up to Ga. 
	    
	    Well, as China is will leave here today, I think I must bring my letter to a close and hope to write again when I reached Ga.

	Hoping you are all well.  Please remembering me to the teachers and pupils.  
	    With best regard 
	    Believe me my dear teacher. 
	    I am 
	    Your most obt pupil 
	     Tsoong Kia Tsing
