   [Letter from Young John Allen to Rev Mssrs Hall & Innocent, November 19, 1866]    
    ShanghaiNov 19th 1866
        Rev Mssrs Hall & Innocent,
    
    At our recent Quarterly Mission meeting, a resolution to invite the return of our native brother Hu (Wu) Ung Ti, who has been for some time an assistant in your mission, to be stationed at Nankin, was unanimously adopted.
    For several years we had meditated such a course but not until recently did the absolute demands of our work require it. This step is necessitated new horrors, by the loss of two of our most promisnent and valuable native members, the extension and interest of our work, the eagerness of our members at Nankin for assistance and the prospect of a good work being begun and promoted in their midst and the pressing urgent demand for his labors in that direction.
    We could not communicate with him and advise his coming however without first informing you of the facts- Having therefore apprized you of the facts and the imperative necessity of our action, we hope you will not only not oppose his coming, but cheerfully give him any assistance that may be required towards securing a passage to Shanghai.
    All the expenses of which we will defray as a matter of course-
    As it is too late to make such a change this winter we hope he will hold himself ready to come by the first opportunity in the ensuing spring. Enclosed I send you a letter addressed to him on the subject, which I hope you will kindly deliver.
    Your successes cheer and encourage us. and Praying God's blessing on you personally and the work which you have so promisingly developed I am your Brother in Christ
        Young J. Allen
