    [Letter from Mary H. Allen to Mellie]
 Montreal:  May 18, 1911

Dear Mellie,

	I did not go by San Francisco, to see Ethel -- felt I could not stand the fatigue of the journey. We have had a very pleasant trip so far, and have met with much kindness from travelling companions. We have stood the trip very well for us, but Alice had such a severe attack of neuralgia day before yesterday that we were obliged to get off the train at Fort William for her to rest. We spent a night and a day there - then came on here. Do you know Montreal? It is a lovely old city. I can't remember if you were ever here. We shall see Mary Turner and the boys and Harry tomorrow, and will make our first visit there. Margaret invited us to visit her in June but I do not feel strong enough to go to Florida in Summer.  

Mrs. Cobb invited us to visit her at Montreal in June and July. I do not know yet just when we shall go South. I am sorry not to see big George and little George sooner. I am so very tired travelling. Shall be so glad to get to Mary's and have a rest.

	Ethel will come east with Mary B. in July. I was very sorry not to see her, but the extra journey from Vancouver to San Francisco would have been so fatiguing to me. I do not like the Canadian Pacific Rail Road. It is extremely rough -- cars do not run smooth. But the trip on the Monteagle was pleasant. Neither Alice or I was really seasick though we had a few rough days -- by keeping on deck we escaped seasickness.

	I hope you and the girls will have a pleasant Summer. Write me at once to Mary Turner's care. Harry is not going South yet awhile.

With much love to all,
Your devoted Mother,
Mary H. Allen
