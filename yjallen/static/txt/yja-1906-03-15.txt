    Atlanta, Ga. 
March 15

My darling wife

I rcd a telegram yesterday summoning me to Washington and I leave here today at noon. An arrangement has been made for me to see the president and the senate committee and I hope something may be done towards hastening a conclusion of the boycott on a satisfactory basis.

Tell Mellie I wrote to Allen immediately of my arrival here, but have not yet seen him and as my time is so short here it is impossible to get to Stone Mountain. I leave the parcel for him at Mr. Prior's and hope he will be able to call for it. Mary is very anxious for me to come on to Savannah, but the authorities have taken charge of me and sent me off to Washington - but I will try to reach her pretty soon. ------- to me.

Your loving husband 
Young J. Allen
