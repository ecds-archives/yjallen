	  My dear George,

Another of your ever welcome letters came to hand on the 19th inst. I fear that you are put to some stress to meet all your calls and write so regularly to me and such long and interesting letters at that. But to a working man engagements are easy and hands always full the normal state of existence. I sincerely pity the dolce far niente of the many laissez faireof whom you and I know. But beside you I seem as nothing. I greatly admire your pluck and industry. Many a man under your weight would sink; but you don't seem to mind the draughfts made on you and bear up astonishingly. Go on brave boy -- the reward of all shall in due time appear. I sincerely sympathise with you in your want of a few "Scoundrel appus" and if I can be of any service to you in effecting the payment foron the little home you have lately bought for your dear wife please utilize the following -- which I assure you it gives me great pleasure to place in your hands.
