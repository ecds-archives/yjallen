  [Letter from T. H. Yun to Young John Allen, September 12, 1891]

 Oxford -- 9/12 -- 91.

Rev. Dr Y. J. Allen.

My dear Doctor;


After having visited nearly 30 different towns--most of them small--in Va, Tenn, Md, and Ky, I am here. I came by Atlanta the day before yesterday; and am sorry that I could not see Mrs Allen.
       
My summer travels were a pleasant experience in my life. The collections after my talk on Corea Korea Ranged between $3.00 and $25.00. The latter sum occurred few and far between; but as the points I touched at were not far apart I could pay my traveling expenses of all sorts, and come to the College with $180.00. If I could manage to visit some towns in Ga during the session, I might be able to pay my way thro this year. Or at least I might get something to pay sundry expenses.

One of the pleasant features of my summer work was the interest and pleasure which many persons manifested on account of their having heard you some years ago. Many told me that they were glad to see me from the school on whose behalf you spoke to them. A young intelligent looking man came up to me after the lecture in a church of Louisville, and said that he was glad to see and hear me because he, after having heard your lecture years ago, had always wished to meet a man brought to Christ thro you and your comrades.

In Lynchburg, I had the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with Miss Fannie Earl and her brother. They spoke of you in the most enthusiastic terms.



The recent riots and uncertainty of affairs in China seem to have very discouraging effect on the friends of missions here. I shall be happy to learn more definitely about the "whereunto" of the disturbance so that I may be able to give needed answers to many inquiries on the subject.

Praying for your good health and happiness,

I remain

Yours very sincerely

T. H. Yun.
