Letter from John Watson to Young John Allen, September 27, 1883
Amoy
27th Sept 1883

Dear Sir,

In answer to your letter to Mr Thompson enquiring about the Kong. Pau. I have to say that of the 54 vol copies vol XV received 30 were distributed (gratis) to Mandarins in & around Amoy 6 are remain neither sold nor given away & 18 were sold. A Chinese book-seller got 20 cents commission on each copy.
I enclose a cheque for $14.40 the balance of $18 after deducting $3.60 commission

I am sorry that we did not manage to sell more.

I am

Yours truly

John Watson
